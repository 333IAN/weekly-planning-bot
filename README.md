## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Synced ✅ but event doesn't appear"
1. Refresh your Google Calendar
2. Check all your calendars (might be hidden)
3. Verify the date/time is in the future
4. Check Apps Script Executions for errors

### Not receiving emails?
1. Verify email address in `Code.js`
2. Run `setWeeklyTriggers()` again
3. Check Gmail spam folder
4. Ensure Google Account permissions are granted

### Task won't submit?
1. Enter both task name AND date/time
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify Google Script deployment URL is correct
4. Ensure "Who has access" is set to "Anyone"

### Need to change email address?
1. Edit `Code.js` → update `recipient` variable
2. Run `clasp push` (or re-paste in Apps Script)
3. No need to redeploy or re-run triggers
